# UFOs

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a website that allows users to explore different UFO sightings and provide easy and comprehensive filters to dig further into the data.

## Results

When a user first enters the site they are greeted with the entire data set within the table, with the filter options on the left side.

When a user adds in a filter, the table will automatically update based on these filters.  This would allow the users to dig into different aspects of the data based on what they're trying to analyze.

## Summary

One drawback of this design is that it is still difficult to understand the full scope of the data set, therefore it's hard to know what to put in the filters to get the data you want.  To solve this I would recommend adding in some drop down filters with existing values, as opposed to the text box.  This would allow users to know what the options are.  

It would also be interesting to add a chart to this that updates based on the users filter parameters.  This could provide easier analysis.
